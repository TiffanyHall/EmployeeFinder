# EmployeeFinder

The EmployeeFinder app is a dating compatibility application. If you are interested in finding your perfect match click the "Go to Survey" button on the home screen. 

Once you are on the survey page, type in your name and add a link to a photo of yourself in the provided spaces. Fill out the short 10 question survey and click submit to view the person whom you are most compatible with.

The name and photo of your best match will be displayed in a pop-up modal and your name, photo and scores will be stored in the employee list to match future matches available. 

If you want to view the full list of possible matches, click the API Employees List link on either the home or survey pages.
